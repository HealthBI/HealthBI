# HealthBI

Requirements:
- Python version: 
- Install pandas: `pip install pandas`
- Install postgres
- Install psycopg2

Note: to test, create database in postgres manually before running HealthBI since there is no script to create database yet.

HealthBI.py is the main script.

Usage: `python HealthBI.py csv_file json_file`

TBD: Setup project on docker
